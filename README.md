# Reject Modernity
why new myportal if old myportal do trick

# Background
de anza college and foothill college have a new portal, it's kinda bad so i made an addon to redirect back to the old portal

# What does this do
redirects you from new fhda myportal to old fhda myportal

also injects css to the old fhda myportal so you don't see the nag message telling you to switch

# Installation
google how to install unpacked extensions because idk either

# What's next
make the extension not ddos fhda servers if they decide to get rid of the new portal
